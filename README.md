# Flight-Control
This repository contains information and contents for flight control.

The Theory-Notes updated are self explanatory but requires prior knowledge of notations and exposure to control eqautions.

DONE:
- simple visualization of controls on flight path but wihtout considering exact eqautions.

TODO:
- Visualize with motion equations, without MPC (50% completed).
- Implement controls with MPC.
